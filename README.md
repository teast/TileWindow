# TileWindow

Make your windows instance more like an "tiling desktop manager".

## How to compile

Download both mingw32 and mingw64.
Add both mingw32 and mingw64 bin folders to your path (important to have mingw64 before mingw32)
Make sure mingw32 is installed to c:\mingw\ folder (or change tasks.json so they point to your mingw32 version)

Press F5.

When you first run TileWindow you will probably have to create an appsettings.json file in same folder as your exe file.
